recommend-classes
=================

A course project for CSL866, Machine Learning course. The dataset I worked with cannot be made public since it contains personal information of students studying at IIT Delhi. The code however is completely public!

The code uses the general terminology of users and items and uses PMF to recommend items to users (or equivalently classes to students.)
